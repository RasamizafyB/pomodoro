# Pomodoro 

> A simple, static, [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) with [React](https://reactjs.org).

- Repository : **`react-pomodoro`**
- Duration : **1 week**
- Deadline : **16/09/2020 17:00**
- Deployment : **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)**


## Minimal requirements

- Display a big timer (minutes and seconds).
- Four buttons:
  - **plus (+)** and **minus (-)**, they will allow the user to adjust the *minutes counter* - **only when it's stopped**.
  - **start**, to run the timer (it will then change to **stop**), to serve as a *toggle* button
  - **reset**, to… reset the timer to its original value
- At the end of the timer, show a modal to invite user to *take a break*. The modal will have two buttons:
  - One to close the modal
  - Another to close the modal *and* start a new timer

## Optional additions

You can add anything to the timer, as long as the minimal requirements are fulfilled.

You can add a sound at the end of the timer, add another timer in the modal to limitate the break time, add animations… feel free to try anything!



## Hosting

We want you to publish your pomodoro online. There's many solutions to host a static website online for free, like [**github-pages**](https://pages.github.com).

We will use a new solution: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).  
It's free, easy to setup, and can observe your changes and publish automatically.
